# **ENHANCING LANGUAGE FLUENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL GAME DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES**




# Introduction

As a game programmer seeking to broaden my horizons and explore opportunities in the Japanese game industry, I plan to improve on my fluency of the language. By incorporating spaced-repetition software, reading, and mock exams, I aim to measure my progress effectively. In this blog I will outline my thought process and my learning progress.


## Significance Of Japanese In The Japanese Game Industry

Although it sounds obvious at first that the Japanese language is significant in terms of your professional ability to tap into the Japanese game industry, many game studios around the world often operate in English regardless of the official language of that country. A good example of this is the fact that the Dutch game studio giant located in Amsterdam, [Guerrilla games](https://www.guerrilla-games.com/join), only provides an English version of their job openings and no Dutch version. There is also no mention of requiring Dutch in their job requirement. This is quite common abroad. English has become the de facto for game development in most of the world. This is also understandable as the programming world is under the same influence. Even IT companies in the secluded island of Japan have recognized this. As an example of this, [Rakuten](https://rakuten.today/blog/englishnization-embracing-global-vision.html), a large IT conglomerate with a revenue larger than that of Ebay, has implemented an “English-only” policy since 2012.

At this point you might question the significance of Japanese in the Japanese gaming industry, especially considering I am a programmer myself. Although large AAA companies in Japan have expanded abroad with studios located everywhere around the world, real development of their franchise games is done in-house and even though they have become large international companies this has unfazed their in-house environment. We can use [Square Enix](https://www.jp.square-enix.com/recruit/career/career/de/game/index.html) and [Nintendo](https://www.jp.square-enix.com/recruit/career/career/de/game/index.html) as an example here. When we look at both of their recruitment websites, besides them being in Japanese and having no English translation, there is no mention of requiring English. Client communication-heavy positions do seem to require “business level English” suggesting that other positions have no such requirement whatsoever. This is also reflected in the presentation given at GDC where developers from all over the world give presentations, including Japanese game developers. Although most of these Japanese game developers require interpreters for their presentations which is very rare at GDC.

Although your English ability might be valued by a Japanese game studio, it is often not worth mentioning in the recruitment pages of large companies. I could go into the whole Japanese culture and why their English proficiency is so low, but the point is that if you want to be able to work for or with Japanese game studios; fluent Japanese is a prerequisite.


# Language Acquisition


## Language Immersion

There are various methods to learn a language. One of these being immersion, which can be a highly effective method for improving one’s fluency in a foreign language. Immersion means surrounding oneself with the target language as much as possible – creating an environment where you are constantly exposed to and using the language you want to learn. Immersion helps you to build an intuition of the language thanks to contextual instruction.

[The input hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis) plays a key role in immersion. Proposed by linguist Stephen Krashen, it suggests that learners acquire language best when they are exposed to meaningful and comprehensible input – i.e., language that is slightly beyond their current level but still understandable. According to Krashen, this is a better method of developing grammatical accuracy than direct grammar teaching. As such I will not be focusing on grammar studies.

I will be using immersion in tandem with sentence mining. Sentence mining is a language learning technique that involves collecting sentences from sources, such as books, blogs, movies, or conversations, for the purpose of studying and reinforcing vocabulary, grammar, and overall language comprehension. The source in this case being my immersion material.

I will then insert these sentences into a space-repetition software for review. In this case I will be using jpdb.io for my spaced-repetition software.


## Immersion Material

For my immersion material I’ll be predominantly relying on two things; books and anime. For listening I’ll be using Anime with subtitles. I use a plugin that allows me to automatically sentence mine words I do not know yet from the subtitles, this will also grab the audio and let me replay it when reviewing. It will generate flashcards that look like this:

</p>

After collecting words using this method I then sort these words by their frequency across various mediums such as the news, movies, books, etc. and learn those words by highest frequency.

Besides anime I also plan to read books. I have bought many physical books that are in Japanese that I have not read yet.

</p>

The method for reading is completely different. As reading is not digital it is very arduous to look up new vocab or kanji. This might be hard to imagine because in English we know all the symbols we use in the language at all times but in Japanese there are thousands of symbols. It is very possible you don’t recognize one. How does one go about looking up a symbol you don’t know? Well one way is to use the radicals of the kanji and look it up that way. This can still easily take over a minute looking up a single symbol yet alone trying to figure out what you’re actually looking at. For this reason I am adopting a method that the SRS jpdb excels at. As this is a very new method there is no established term for this but the community often refers to it as pre-learning. Pre-learning is when you study the vocab contained in a specific immersion item before immersing in it. The reason jpdb excels at this approach is because it has “pre-built” decks. These are curated decks that contain the vocabulary used in specific pieces of work such as movies, books, games, etc. it also contains the frequency of these words within the aforementioned work. I then start learning vocab in order of that frequency.

In conclusion, by incorporating various methods such as immersion-based learning through Sentence Mining, reading Japanese materials combined with pre-learning techniques, and assessment, I believe that I can improve my fluency faster than other traditional methods. The key is keeping motivation high through active engagement rather than passive memorization exercises.

In that aspect, pre-learning aids in that as it helps reduce frustration when encountering unknown words but also helps build confidence by improving one’s ability to understand context without relying heavily on dictionaries.


# Measuring Comprehension and Progress

I’ll be measuring my comprehension using 2 methods:



* Known vocab count
* JLPT mock exam


## Known Vocab Count

Although very simplified I think a vocabulary count is the purest form of someone’s comprehension ability. It is not possible to comprehend a message when parts of it are not understood. Regardless of how advanced your understanding of grammar is. Likewise no matter how many words you have memorized, if you do not understand the grammar used, comprehending the meaning of what is said will also be perilous. Although assessing someone’s vocabulary can be hard, fortunately jpdb keeps track of all the vocab I’ve acquired through sentence mining and reviewing. Since I’ve started I’ve acquired over roughly 9 thousand words of the almost 13 thousand words I have mined.

which has cost me roughly 11.3 thousand minutes to review the flashcards alone

## JLPT Mock Exam

As mentioned prior a simple vocab count lacks context of listening ability and grammar understanding.

I’ll be using sample questions of the N2 from JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test). N5 being the lowest level and N1 being the highest level. I think this will serve as a good metric of my comprehension and the progress I’ve made. N2 is also the minimum level required for foreign workers at Japanese companies, fitting for my personal goal.

I’ve used the sample question available from the official website: https://www.jlpt.jp/e/samples/forlearners.html

I score 7/19 (37%) correct before my study

I scored 16/19 correct (84%) after. An increase of 47%.

# Reflection

I think the results speak for themselves. However, one thing I think was lacking in my research was a larger focus on terminology specific to the gaming industry such as using Japanese documentation and talks about game development for my immersion. That could’ve been one improvement point for the future. Overall I am happy with the results and hope to invest further time into the specific terminology I will have to learn to partake in the Japanese game industry.
